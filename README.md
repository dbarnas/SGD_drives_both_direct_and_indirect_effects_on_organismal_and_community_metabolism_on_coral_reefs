#### Abstract
Coral reefs experience a multitude of environmental gradients affecting organismal physiology and species biodiversity, which ultimately lead to changes in community metabolism. In this study, we show that submarine groundwater discharge (SGD), a common natural environmental gradient in coastal ecosystems, has both direct and indirect effects on coral reef community metabolism by altering individual growth rates and community composition. Specifically, our data revealed that growth of two algal (Halimeda opuntia and Valonia fastigiata) and one coral (Porites rus) species were hindered when exposed to high SGD water for six weeks. When measuring community metabolic rates, we showed that net community production, respiration, and net calcification were altered mostly by differences in community identity between naturally high and low exposure areas, rather than the direct effect of the SGD itself. Community production and calcification were lowest in assemblages that represent high SGD communities regardless of environmental treatment. However, there was a significant interaction between assemblage type and environmental exposure to SGD for respiration. By demonstrating the role of SGD in altering community composition and metabolism, this research highlights the critical need to consider such environmental gradients in the broader context of complex ecosystem functions.
