#### Abstract
Coral reefs experience a multitude of environmental gradients affecting species biodiversity, which ultimately lead to changes in community metabolism (net community production, respiration, and calcification). In this study, we tested the impact of a common natural environmental gradient on coral reef metabolism, submarine groundwater discharge (SGD). SGD is the expulsion of terrestrial water into a marine environment and exhibits distinct characteristics. We first assessed community compositional differences in high and low SGD exposure along a fringing coral reef in Mo’orea, French Polynesia. We then directly tested the effect of SGD on the growth of common species in each community type, as well as the interactive effect of SGD exposure and community composition differences on community metabolism. Growth of three dominant species was hindered in high SGD, while ecosystem functioning was altered by differences in community identity between naturally high and low exposure areas. Environmental exposure to SGD only increased respiration of communities found naturally in areas of low exposure. SGD is present across multiple ecosystems globally and provides a unique opportunity to study community responses across a variety of ecosystems. This study examines multivariable environmental shifts occurring naturally within SGD gradients to understand how future variability may alter ecosystem stability.
